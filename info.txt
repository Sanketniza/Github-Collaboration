    ## collaborators:
        - Sanket Talekar. (Main Maintainer or admin)
        - Krinsha Wankhede.
        - Suresh Halkude.

    ## FIrst step of admin (me: Sanket Talekar) 
        - Create folder and initial files.
        - Push to GitHub repo.
        - Add the collaborators.

        - merger(main) will do the following steps:
            >> Featch the changes from the collaborator branch.
                - git fetch

            >> Switch to main branch if not on main branch.
                - git switch main

            >> Merge the collaborator branch to main branch.
                - git merge collaborator_branch_name

            >> Push the changes to GitHub main repo.
                - git push origin main    

            >> Review the pull request.
            >> Test the changes locally.
            >> Merge the changes to the main branch.
            >> Delete the feature branch after merging (optional).

    ## Second step of collaborators (Krinsha Wankhede and Suresh Halkude)
        - Fork or copy the repo to their GitHub account.
        - Create a new branch.
            >> git switch -c feature/addignorefile (this is an example)
            >> to check the current branch use: git branch 
            >> to switch branch use: git switch branch_name
        - Make changes in their local system.
            - Add the changed files.
                >> git add file_name or git add . (to add all changed files)
            - Commit the changes with a message.
                >> git commit -m "Add a meaningful commit message"
            - push the changes to their GitHub repo.
                >> git push -u origin collaborator_branch_name        
        - Commit and push the changes to their GitHub repo.
        - Inform to admin or Create a pull request to the main repo.
        - Wait for review and merge by the admin.    

        >> Once the code is merged by admin, collaborators need to sync their local repo with main repo.
            - git fetch
            - git switch main
            ------ git merge origin/main <= This is optional step. No need to merge here. We can directly pull.
            - git pull or git pull origin main <<- No need to to merge. pull means merge and fetch both in one command.
            - git switch collaborator_branch_name <- if they want to continue working on their branch.
            - git merge main <- to sync their branch with main branch.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------            

To bring the latest main changes into your feature/adding-signIn-page branch, do this:

    1> Get the latest from GitHub
        - git fetch origin

    2> Switch to your feature branch
       -If you already have it locally:
            -git checkout feature/adding-signIn-page

    • If you don’t have it locally yet (only on GitHub):
        - git checkout -b feature/adding-signIn-page origin/feature/adding-signIn-page

    3> Pull/merge main into your feature branch (recommended simple way)
        - git merge origin/main

    4> Push the updated feature branch back to GitHub
        - git push origin feature/adding-signIn-page


    5> If you prefer a cleaner history (optional, rewrites commits):
        - git rebase origin/main
        - then push with: git push --force-with-lease origin feature/adding-signIn-page

--  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Do this to bring feature/adding-signIn-page changes into main, then push main to GitHub:

    1> Update your local refs
        - git fetch origin

    2> Switch to main and make sure it’s up to date
        - git checkout main <- or git switch main <- this is for
        - git pull origin main 

    3> Merge the feature branch into main
        - git merge origin/feature/adding-signIn-page

    4> Push updated main to GitHub
        - git push origin main

    6> If you get merge conflicts in step 3:
        open the conflicted files, fix them
            - git add .
            - git commit (Git will suggest a merge commit message)
            - git push origin main

    7> Optionally, delete the feature branch if no longer needed
        - git branch -d feature/adding-signIn-page <- deletes local branch
